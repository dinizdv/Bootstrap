> They are building blocks that contains, pads, and aligns content whithin a given device or viewport. 

-> container types
.container -> max-width changes at each breakpoint. It is a responsive class.

.container-fluid -> total screen width (100%).

.container-{breakpoint} -> 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached.

-> See the illustration I made about responsive containers in the 'Bootstrap - Containers.png' file.
